# Would Your Rather

A very simple "Would You Rather" game built with React & Redux.

## Getting Started

**Note: This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).**

1 - Before you start working, you first need to setup your environment. Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) (npm alternative but better)

2 - Once your environment is prepared, open a command prompt (terminal) and type in the following:

- git clone https://github.com/arslan-khan/would-you-rather.git
- cd would-you-rather
- yarn (to install all the dependencies)
- yarn start

3 - Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. "**Hallelujah**".

4 - For more productivity you can install Chrome's [React Developer Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en) and [Redux Dev Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd?hl=en).

## Available Scripts

- [yarn start](#yarn-start)
- [yarn test](#yarn-test) (aren't writing any tests)
- [yarn run build](#yarn-run-build)
- [yarn run eject](#yarn-run-eject)

### `#yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `#yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `#yarn run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `#yarn run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Style Guide

Currently we don't have any official style guide from facebook, but there is a pretty popular one from "**AirBnB**".

- [AirBnB Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/react)

Make sure you follow them.

## Project Specific

**Note: Never run yarn clean command, otherwise it will crash our app.**

1 - Try to use some good editor/IDE.

2 - Make sure your editor/IDE have support for the following:

- ES6/React/JSX/Babel
- .gitigonore
- .editorconfig
- .eslint
- prettier

3 - Use single 'QUOTES' only.

4 - Last but not the least, keep it simple keep it real.
